This repository contains a Power BI dashboard designed for analyzing the performance of a call center. The dashboard provides key metrics and visualizations to help understand the efficiency, performance, and customer experience of the call center operations.

## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard includes the following main sections:

### 1. Call Volume Analysis
- **Daily and Hourly Call Volume**: A line chart showing the distribution of calls received throughout the day and week. This helps identify peak hours and allocate resources accordingly.
